	  Research Question: In pursuit of optimizing our model to predict interest rate 
using independent variables (quantitative/qualitative), we keep a sharp eye on such
issues as normality, heteroscedasticity, linearity, and multicollinearity. How do we
properly address, if need be, these issues? How do we select the, in a sense, most 
effective model to predict interest rate? Simply put, what could be better and do better
than this?

Call:
lm(formula = my.data$int_rate ~ my.data$loan_amnt + my.data$home_ownership + 
    my.data$annual_inc + my.data$application_type + my.data$emp_length)

A quick take away is that, 
1. The more you borrow, the higher the interest rate.
2. Mortgage borrowers are favored.
3. The more you make each year, the less interest you have to pay.
4. Joint loan applications get robbed. This is probably because only people with bad credit 
are getting joint loan apps.
5. It seems that 0-3 years loans have the lowest interest rate. After that, it just gets randomly shot up.

A couple of thoughts.
1. Maybe we should consider using a quadratic approach on variables such as loan amount and annual income.
2. Use interaction terms between home ownership and loan maturity.
